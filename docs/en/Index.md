# ASN

ASN (Advanced Shipping Notice) is an application that provides the possibility of controlling shipments of boxes and pallets of orders between material suppliers and TKE, keeping records and ensuring that they are carried out efficiently.

By requesting a shipment in the JAG application, the order is placed, it reaches the ASN application to control it and, if everything is correct, it allows the connection with the SAP application to finish the shipping process and know that it has arrived correctly.
