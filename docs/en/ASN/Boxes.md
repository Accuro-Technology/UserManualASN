## Create New Box

- This button allows registering a new box in the system.

- When selected, a form is displayed in which users must enter the required information:

    * name of the box: an identifying name that allows the box to be easily recognized. Example: "Large Box #1", "Electronic Box". Helps to quickly organize and locate the box in an inventory or management system. 

    * Width: The horizontal measurement of the box when viewed from the front. The units can be specified in centimeters, inches, meters or other units depending on the configuration. For example: 30 cm, 12 inches. Key to determining the space the box will occupy, especially in storage or transport. 

    * Height: The vertical measurement of the box from the base to the top. The units of measurement are similar to the width, specified in cm, inches, etc. This data is necessary to calculate the total volume of the box and to verify its adequacy in spaces with height restrictions. 

    * Length: The horizontal measurement of the box from front to back. It is measured in the same units as width and height. Example: 40 cm, 16 inches. Along with width and height, it determines the volume and space required for storage. 

    * Size units: Specifies the measurement system used for the dimensions of the box. Example: Centimeters (cm), inches (in), meters (m). It unifies measurements and avoids errors when mixing different unit systems. 

    * Gross weight: The total weight of the box, including its contents, packaging and any additional material. Units: Kilograms (kg), pounds (lb), etc. Example: 12 kg, 26 lb. It is essential for calculating transportation costs and complying with maximum weight regulations. 

    * Net weight: The weight of the contents of the box excluding packaging. Units: Same unit as gross weight (kg, lb, etc.). Example: 10 kg, 22 lb. Useful for determining the value of the contents, especially in trade and inventory. 

    * Weight units: System of measurement for weight (kilograms, pounds, etc.). Example: kg, lb. Ensures consistency in measurements and avoids interpretation errors, especially in international contexts. 

- The form includes validations to ensure data integrity before saving.

    These fields together ensure that boxes can be properly identified, measured, weighed and transported. They facilitate logistics, warehousing, inventory and trade by providing all key information about the physical characteristics of each box. 

    <b>The box needs to be created here so that it is recorded in the system and can be available later in the packaging section, ensuring that the correct specifications are used in downstream processes.</b>
