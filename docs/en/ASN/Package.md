# 2.2.5 Package

**2.2.5.1 Overview**

In the "Package" section we have access to the orders that have been previously con
firmed in the Jaggaer system, have been received by the ASN 2.0 system and are ready 
to begin the packaging process. 

In this section, you can only select orders individually. If you want to combine boxes from 
different orders, you can do so later in the application. 

In the Packaging section, a list of the packages made is displayed, providing the order 
number, the address to which it is being sent, the number of boxes to be sent and a 
"Delivery Notes" options button.

- You can select a complete position, or several, and pack it in its entirety using the pallet and 
box buttons on the right. To select it, you must use the check mark on the left of the position.

Items must be grouped and the batch number, certificate number and

certificate number is missing, the order cannot be confirmed. It can be completed 
in the “Packaging” section and the order can be confirmed.

shipments.
